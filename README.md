# King County House Sales Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the King County House Sales dataset to provide insights into the real estate market in King County, Washington. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, the aim is to predict house prices based on various property characteristics and determine how renovations might affect property values. This analysis will assist real estate agencies and homeowners in making informed decisions regarding property sales and renovations.

## Objectives
1. **Develop a Predictive Model:** Build a linear regression model to predict property prices using historical data and property characteristics.
2. **Understand Key Features:** Identify the key features that significantly impact property prices.
3. **Improve Decision Making:** Provide a reliable tool for estimating property prices to enhance decision-making for stakeholders.
4. **Evaluate Model Performance:** Use appropriate metrics to assess the accuracy and performance of the model.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, `kc_house_data.csv`, includes sales prices of houses in King County, Washington, along with attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. A separate file, `column_names.md`, provides descriptions of the column names.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science process:
- **Data Collection and Inspection:** Gather and inspect the provided dataset.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to find patterns, relationships, and insights.
- **Modeling:** Build predictive models to estimate house prices based on selected features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the models' performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Interpretation:** Draw conclusions from the model results and provide recommendations.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`index.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.


## Data Understanding

The initial phase of the project involves importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and various sklearn modules for preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. The dataset is then loaded for inspection, revealing it contains 21,597 rows and 21 columns, encompassing a wide range of property characteristics.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the King County House Sales dataset to aid a real estate agency in making informed decisions regarding property sales and renovations. Through meticulous data preparation, exploratory analysis, and model development, we strive to uncover the factors that significantly influence house prices in King County, Washington.
